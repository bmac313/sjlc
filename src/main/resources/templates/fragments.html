    <p>We accept the Bible-based teachings of salvation by Grace alone, Scripture alone, Faith alone.</p>
    <p>A more detailed summary of our beliefs can be found in Luther's Small Catechism, which you can <a href="http://catechism.cph.org/" target="_blank">read freely online</a> courtesy of Concordia Publishing House.</p>

    <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
    <p>The three Protestant Solas - Grace alone, Scripture alone, Faith alone - are at the core of our Lutheran theology. If you're wondering, here is a short summary of each.</p>
    <section>
        <div class="inline-box width-30">
            <h4>Grace Alone</h4>
            <i class="fas fa-heart"></i>
            <p>God loves the people of the world, even though they are sinful, rebel against Him, and do not deserve His love. He sent Jesus Christ, His only-begotten Son, to love the unlovable and save the ungodly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="inline-box width-30">
            <h4>Faith Alone</h4>
            <i class="fas fa-fire"></i>
            <p>By His suffering and death as the substitute for all people of all time, Jesus purchased and won forgiveness of sins and eternal life in heaven for all who believe in Him. God creates faith in Christ and gives people forgiveness through Him.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="inline-box width-30">
            <h4>Scripture Alone</h4>
            <i class="fas fa-book"></i>
            <p>The Bible is God's inerrant and infallible Word, in which He reveals His Law and His Gospel of salvation in Jesus Christ. It is the only rule and norm for Christian doctrine.</p>
        </div>

<div th:fragment="worship-page-body">
    <h2 th:text="${header}"></h2>
    <p>We at St. John's are committed to liturgical, Lutheran worship. Services are taken from the Lutheran Service Book with an occasional service based upon the theme of the day of the Church Year.  The Divine Service  is often supported by the adult and children's choirs.</p>
    <p>Our understanding of worship is summarized by the following statement found in the hymnal Lutheran Worship:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"Our Lord speaks and we listen. His Word bestows what it says. Faith that is born from what is heard acknowledges the gifts received with eager thankfulness and praise. Music is drawn into this thankfulness and praise, enlarging and elevating the adoration of God, our gracious giver.</p>
        <p>Saying back to Him what He has said to us, we repeat what is most true and sure. Most true and sure is His name, which He put upon us with the water of our Baptism. We are His. This we acknowledge at the beginning of the Divine Service. Where His name is, there is He.</p>
        <p>Before Him we acknowledge that we are sinners, and we plead for forgiveness. His forgiveness is given to us, and we, freed and forgiven, acclaim Him as our great and gracious God as we apply to ourselves the words He has used to make Himself known to us.</p>
        <p>The rhythm of our worship is from Him to us, and then from us back to Him. He gives His gifts, and together we receive and extol them. We build one another up as we speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. Our Lord gives us His Body to eat and His Blood to drink. Finally His blessing moves us out into our calling, where His gifts have their fruition. How best to do this we may learn from His Word and from the way His Word has prompted His worship through the centuries. We are heirs of an astonishingly rich tradition. Each generation receives from those who went before and, in making that tradition of the Divine Service its own, adds what best may serve in its own day - the living heritage and something new."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Communion Practice</h3>
    <p>The Lord’s Supper is celebrated every Lord’s Day. Those who gather at the Lord’s Table publicly confess that they are in doctrinal unity with one another. According to God’s Word, the entire congregation declares the central truth of our faith, that Christ gave His body and blood to redeem us from our sins.</p>
    <p>We acknowledge what His promise that He is actually present, not just spiritually present, with His true body and blood in the bread and wine to forgive our sins. From 1 Cor 11:29 we learn, “For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.”</p>
    <p>Therefore, out of Christian love and concern for all who desire to come to the Lord’s Table, and as doctrinal unity is central to this common proclamation of Christ’s saving work on our behalf, the churches of the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod have pledge to practice close(d) communion. Those who are confirmed members, in good standing, of an LC-MS congregation are invited to come to the LOrd’s Table.  Visitors are asked to speak with to the pastor to learn about receiving instruction in our doctrine before partaking of the Lord’s Supper.</p>

    <p><strong>FIRST STEPS:</strong> The earliest beginings of St. John's Lutheran Congregation date back to the early 1860's when Gottlob Schmidt, a member of Trinity Lutheran Church in Springfield, arranged to have services held in his home. Pastor Bartling, of Trinity Church, came occassionally to conduct services and to administer the Sacaments of Baptism and Holy Communion. Some years later August Bliefnick joined Schmidt and they arranged with Pastor Burkhardt to hold services every two weeks in the Dave Harmon school house 1 and 1/4 miles east of Chatham. Here church-school was also heled during the summer months for children. Later this small unorganized group was served by Pastors Benson and Lochner of Springfield and by students of Concordia Seminary.</p>
    <p><strong>CONGREGATION ORGANIZED:</strong> Under the leadership of Rev. Lochner, pastor of Trinty Lutheran Church, Springfield, St. John's Congregation was organized in October 1877, and pledged itself to the Lutheran faith and practice. Seeing the need for a place for worship, the congregation erected a frame church building on what would later be known as the Carl Wykoks farm, one mile east of Chatham.</p>
    <p>After a decade of faithful service from Pastor Lochner, the congregation come under the care of Prof. A. Craemer, President of Concordia Seminary in Springfield.  he served the congregation from 1887 to 1891 with the assistance of students from the Seminary. Students who were assigned were Messrs. Wenzel, Hueschen, Heinke, Jank, Beil, Wendt, and Wagner.</p>
